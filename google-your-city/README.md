## Reliance on other resources
I based my map from an inspiration of this map, where I input my code based on this creator's map: https://labs.mapbox.com/bites/00082/site.js & https://labs.mapbox.com/bites/00082/ and also took some notes from mapbox "Analyze data with Turf.js and Mapbox GLJS :https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/analysis-with-turf/
## Reflective Analysis

I designed this map for the general vancouver and education community to allow the users to explore and analyse the mobility for the disabled community in Vancouver. Some of the questions that I attempt to raise are why some disabled parking are located where they are? How does it affect the crip mobility of Vancouver in terms of disabled parking and transit station?
My map is successful in ways that it provides a view that was not previously seen by the general public by incorporating disabled parking and transit stations. However, my map is unsuccessful in terms of I should include other variables that may affect the crip mobility such as benches. Furthermore, I couldn't solve the errors that were present in my code, which led to my map not being able to show the markers and undergo the buffer I wanted.

I tried to follow a visual hiearchy when it came to designing my map where I wanted to highlight the disabled parkings that were located within the buffer.
My map incorporates interactivity by incorporating the turf.buffer to allow the user to put in different distances to see which disabled parking is located within the buffer of a transit station. This helps the user to better understand the disabled population mobility in Vancouver.

I would like to put more or combine the different layers by creating a suitability score and maybe viewing different layers one by one rather then presenting all of it through a button of each layor. Lastly, I would like to combine all the variables to see which areas of Vancouver is more accessible for the crip population.
