# Vancouver Transportation of Crip Mobility
## Interesting Screenshot of my map
## Link to my map
## Reliance on other resources
### I based my map from an inspiration of this map, where I input my code based on this creator's map: https://labs.mapbox.com/bites/00082/site.js & https://labs.mapbox.com/bites/00082/
## Reflective Analysis
### Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?
I designed this map for the general vancouver community and education community to allow the users to explore and analyse the mobility for the disabled community in Vancouver. Some of the questions that I attempt to raise are why some disabled parking are located where they are? How does it affect the crip mobility of Vancouver in terms of disabled parking and transit station?
My map is successful in ways that it provides a view that was not previously seen by the general public by incorporating disabled parking and transit stations. However, my map is unsuccessful in terms of I should include other variables that may affect the crip mobility such as the benches
### What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
I tried to follow visual hiearchy when it came to designing my map where I wanted to highlight the disabled parkings that were located within the buffer of the transit station.
### How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
My map incorporates interactivity by incorporating the turf.buffer to allow the user to put in different distances to see which disabled parking is located within the buffer of a transit station.
### What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
### In what ways could your map be improved?  Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
I would like to put more or combine the different layers by creating a suitability score and maybe viewing different layers one by one rather then presenting all of it. Maybe combining all the variables to see which areas of Vancouver is more accessible for the crip population.
